# Sudoku-solver
A code that solves a sudoku for you
Empty spaces are represtented with a 0 so if your sudoku has a empty 7 empty in a column you will type that as 0 7 0. Once you typed in the first column pressing enter will put you in a new column and when you type in a full sudoku pressing enter will give you a resolved sudoku.
