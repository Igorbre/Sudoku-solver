# Sudoku-solver
A code that solves a sudoku for you
Empty spaces are represented with a 0, so if your sudoku has a empty 7 empty in a row you will type that as 0 7 0. Once you typed in the first row pressing enter will put you in a new row and when you type in a full sudoku pressing enter will give you a resolved sudoku.
