# Sudoku-solver
This program represents an implementation of a Sudoku solver written in the C++ programming language. Sudoku, a popular logic-based game, involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each digit appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.

Input for the Sudoku problem is provided through the terminal, where empty spaces are denoted by '0'. For instance, if there are 7 empty spaces in the first row, input is entered as "0 7 0", where each digit represents a value at a specific position.

Upon entering the entire Sudoku problem and pressing the "Enter" key, the program initiates the solving process. The result is displayed in the terminal as the fully solved Sudoku.

This Sudoku solver utilizes efficient search algorithms and backtracking to systematically explore all possible digit combinations and find the correct solution.
